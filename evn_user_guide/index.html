						<p>Congratulations on getting EVN data! What's next?<br><br>

<a href="http://www.jive.eu">JIVE</a> correlates all <a href="http://www.evlbi.org/intro/intro.html">EVN</a> observations and performs a preliminary reduction using the <a href="http://www.evlbi.org/pipeline/user_expts.html">EVN pipeline</a>. At this point you would have received an email from your EVN Support Scientist with details on how to access and download your data. You should take a look at the results from the pipeline analysis. In general the pipeline results are expected to be used <b>only</b> as a guide and should not be considered as a final science product. We recommend using the amplitude calibration table from the pipeline as the starting point of a manual calibration of the data. The fringe-fit, bandpass calibration, and imaging should thus be done by the user.<br><br>

We recommend using <a href="http://www.aips.nrao.edu/index.shtml">AIPS</a> to perform the initial reduction and calibration of EVN data as, to-date, other packages do not have the ability to fringe fit data, which is integral for non-connected element arrays. <!--This guide is written for the simple case of a phase-referenced continuum experiment.-->
Martin Shepherd's <a href="ftp://ftp.astro.caltech.edu/pub/difmap/difmap.html">Difmap</a> program can also be used for imaging and self-calibrating EVN data.<br><br>

		This page is intended to be a guide for new users that want to analyze EVN data, describing the standard steps that are performed during the data reduction. A basic knowledge of radio interferometric data and <a href="http://www.aips.nrao.edu/index.shtml">AIPS</a> is required to fully understand all the steps.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-10">
                        <h1 class="page-header" id="obtaining_data">Obtaining the data</h1>
					
						<h3 class="page-header" id="data_archive">EVN Data Archive</h3>
						<p>
						After correlation, the EVN Support Scientists will send you an email with details on how to access and download your data. The data, together with the EVN pipeline results, are stored at the <a href="http://www.jive.eu/select-experiment">EVN Data Archive</a>, where you can find useful information concerning your experiment:
						<ul>
							<li><B>Feedback page</B> containing the feedback from each station and providing information about local circumstances during the observation.
							<li><B>Logfiles page</B> containing the station logfiles, schedule files, and all detailed instrumental settings during the observation.
							<li><B>Standard plots</B> showing the quality of the correlated experiment. These plots are produced after the correlation and show the behavior of the stations along the observation.
							<li><B>Pipeline results</B> providing a more detailed impression of the quality of the data. It contains plots for each source separately. Whereas the final results from the pipeline <B>should not be considered</B> for science results, we encourage the users to use the a-priori amplitude calibration table (CL2) and flag table (FG1) from the pipeline to start a manual calibration (see below).
							<li><B>Fits files</B> with the correlated data in IDI format.
						</ul>
						All these results would provide a good feedback about possible issues arising the data during the observation. We recommend to download all the IDI files plus the <em>AIPS calibration tables</em> from the EVN Pipeline (<em>experiment_name</em>.tasav.FITS file; click in the <em>Pipeline</em> tab and then right click in <em>AIPS calibration tables</em>). This file contains the extension tables that have been applied to your data in the Pipeline, and you can find a more detailed summary of which may be found in the <em>Short summary of CL/SN table contents</em> section.
						</p>
						
						<h3 class="page-header" id="import_data">Loading the data into AIPS</h3>
						<p>
						AIPS runs in a dedicated environment that do not support long path names. For this reason it is recommended to set up an environment variable, <tt><i>MYDIR</i></tt>, with the working directory where your data are:
						</p>
						<div class="well well-sm">
							<div class="container">
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-xs-4">
										<tt>setenv MYDIR <i>path-to-the-data</i></tt><br>
									</div>
									<div class="col-xs-4">
										# for tcsh terminals<br>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-xs-4">
										<tt>export MYDIR=<i>path-to-the-data</i></tt>
									</div>
									<div class="col-xs-4">
										# for bash terminals<br>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
						We note that AIPS automatically recognizes <tt>PWD</tt> as an environment variable, thus in case that your working directory is the same as the directory from where AIPS is launched you do not need the previous step.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b>Now we can start AIPS by typing:</b>
						</p>
						<div class="well well-sm">
							<tt>aips tv=local:0</tt>
						</div>
						<p>The <tt>tv=local:0</tt> parameter is optional but it assures that a new graphical window will be open in case of having other AIPS sessions already opened.<br>
						AIPS will then ask you for a user number. This guide assumes you are using an "empty" AIPS user number (not used before or with no data inside).
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Loading the data into AIPS using the task <tt>FITLD</tt></b>:
						</p>
						<div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-5">
						<div class="well well-sm">
							<tt>
							default 'fitld'<br>
							datain '<i>MYDIR:EXPERIMENT</i>_1_1.IDI<br>
							digicor -1<br>
							doconcat 1<br>
							ncount <i>n</i><br>
							outname <i>'name'</i><br>
							go fitld
							</tt>
						</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-7">
						<div class="panel panel-warning">
							<div class="panel-heading">
								Be careful!
							</div>
							<div class="panel-body">
							Note that there is no trailing number after "IDI" and no closing quote. This way AIPS will load files from 1 to <i>n</i>, concatenating all files together in a single file called <i>name</i>. If you do not close quotes then AIPS is also case-sensitive (otherwise it is case-insensitive assuming always capital letters).<br> Assuming that the used user number was empty, the data is now loaded into catalog number 1 (you can list all the catalog entries with <em>pca</em>).
							</div>
						</div>
						</div>
						</div>
						<div class="panel panel-success">
							<div class="panel-heading">
								<h5>AIPS output</h5>
								The message server will notify you that your data are being loaded. This may take a while as a function of the size of your data. The data will have finished loading when the message server says that FITLD "Appears to have ended successfully."
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							Now we need to load the file containing the calibration tables and copy the appropriate ones to our data:
						</p>
						<div class="well well-sm">
							<tt>
							tget fitld<br>
							datain '<i>MYDIR:EXPERIMENT</i>_tasav.FITS<br>
							doconcat -1<br>
							ncount 1<br>
							outname <i>'name'</i><br>
							go fitld
							</tt>
						</div>
						<div class="panel panel-success">
							<div class="panel-heading">
								<h5>AIPS output</h5>
								Now you will found these data as a second catalog entry (can be selected with <tt>getn 2</tt>).
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							We generally recommend using the a-priori amplitude calibration provided by the EVN pipeline (CL2 from this last file), and applying the flags from FG1 (which for example automatically flags the off-source times for each telescope). We can copy these tables to our data using <tt>TACOP</tt>:
						</p>
						<div class="well well-sm">
							<tt>
							default 'tacop'<br>
							getn 2<br>
							geton 1<br>
							inext 'CL'<br>
							inver 2<br>
							ncount 1<br>
							go tacop
							</tt>
						</div>
						<div class="well well-sm">
							<tt>
							tget tacop<br>
							inext 'FG'<br>
							inver 1<br>
							ncount 1<br>
							go tacop
							</tt>
						</div>
						<div class="panel panel-success">
							<div class="panel-heading">
								<h5>AIPS output</h5>
								The task <tt>TACOP</tt> copies the table CL number 2 (selected by <tt>invers</tt>) from the tasav file (<tt>getn 2</tt>) to our data (<tt>geton 1</tt>). We repeat the same but for the FG table 1. 
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							We can check that both tables have been correctly copied by typing <tt>getn 1</tt> and <tt>imh</tt>, which shows us the header of that catalog entry. The output should be equivalent to:

								Here AIPS shows us the basic data from our experiment. In particular, we can see:
								<ul>
									<li>The number of recorded polarizations (STOKES 4, which means full polarization: RR, LL, RL, LR).
									<li>The frequency setup of the observation (FREQ 32 4.9269900E+09 and IF 8, which means that we have observed at the central frequency of 4.9 GHz with 8 IFs, or subbands, of 32 channels each). Each channel with a bandwidth of 0.5 MHz.
									<li>The coordinates of the phase center (RA and DEC).
									<li>The existing tables in the data (e.g. 1 FG table and 2 CL tables). CL1 corresponds to the pristine calibration table and CL2 to the a-priori calibration table that we just copied from the pipeline, and contains the amplitude correction for each station and the parallactic angle corrections.
								</ul>

						Before starting the calibration we should take a look at the data. We can start running <tt>LISTR</tt> and <tt>PRTAN</tt> to get information about the observed sources and the stations that participated during the observation.
						</p>
						<div class="well well-sm">

						<div class="panel panel-success">
							<div class="panel-heading">
								<h5>AIPS output</h5>
								<tt>LISTR</tt> will show us the scans of the experiment, at which time they were observed and which source. Finally it will summarize all the observed sources and how many visibilities have been recorded per source, and the frequency set up (the central frequency, bandwidth and spectral separation for each IF).
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="well well-sm">

							<div class="panel-heading">
								<h5>AIPS output</h5>
								<tt>PRTAN</tt> reads the information available in the AN table (antenna information) and provides the frequency setup for each station (we note that in the EVN different stations can exhibit slightly different frequency setups due to different receivers/configurations). At the end it also shows a summary with all the stations that participated in the observation and their coordinates with respect to the Earth's center.

						<p>
							One of the (many!) nice things about VLBI is that most terrestrial RFI will not correlate. The FG1 table that we already imported flags some data such as the edge-channels or the off-source times. Nonetheless, there are times that flagging is necessary. AIPS has several flagging tasks such as <tt>UVFLG, TVFLG, SPFLG</tt> and <tt>RFLAG</tt>. Use plotting tasks such as <tt>POSSM</tt> and <tt>UVPLT</tt> to determine if you wish to flag any data. You should also look at the pipeline plots (e.g., plots of amplitude and phase against frequency channel) as they will provide invaluable information about the location of bad data. It is recommended that obvious bad data is flagged from your calibrators to ensure a good calibration. See an example of the plots that you can produce with these tasks in the following buttons:

										<p>
											If your observation was conducted at frequencies &#8818; 5 GHz you probably want to correct for ionospheric effects. Given that the stations are located at huge distances (up to 10,000 km apart), the ionospheric conditions can be really different at each location, affecting in a different way to each station.
										</p>
										<p>
											Although there are different approaches to correct for the ionospheric effects, here we will show how to run <tt>VLBATECR</tt>, which is part of the VLBA utilities. First, we need to type (if we have not done it before) <tt>run vlbautil</tt> to load all these utilities. And then:
										</p>
										<div class="well well-sm">
											<tt>
												default 'vlbatecr'<br>
												getn 1<br>
												go vlbatecr
											</tt>
										</div>
										<p>										
											This task will download the appropriate files from <a href="http://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov">CDDIS</a> and then it will run <tt>TECOR</tt> with these files. We will get a new CL table (CL3) containing these corrections. Note that in the following the user guide <b>assumes that you did not perform this correction</b> and the next calibration takes CL2. In case you correct for this effect, all <tt>gainu/gainv</tt> parameters will need to use one version higher than mentioned in theuUser guide (i.e. gainv 3 instead of gainv 2, and so on).

						<h3 class="page-header" id="instr_delay">Removing instrumental delay</h3>

						<p>
							You may have noticed in <tt>POSSM</tt> that there is not only a gradient in phase within each IF, but the mean phases for each IF are also quite different with jumps in between. This is due to the independent signal paths for each IF, and must be corrected for (there are not physical jumps in the phases between IFs, they clearly have an instrumental origin).<br><br>

							In this step we will be correcting for instrumental delays, the phase jumps between IFs, and as such we only want data over a short time period because we do not want changes as a function of time to come into play (these delays should be constant along the whole observation). This is why it is important to have bright calibrators for VLBI observations! The effect of removing instrumental delays is to bring all the phases to zero, at least for the chosen time range. To correct the instrumental delay choose a few minutes on a bright fringe-finder (FF) when all antennas observed and the data is free of RFI.

										We have considered here the most common case where we have a time range where all stations were observing without problems. However, this is not always true. We can have observations were only part of the stations were observing the fringe-finder in given scan, and the other stations were observing the fringe finder in a different scan (either the same source or a different one). This can happen, for example, in the case of observing with Asian, European, and American stations. At a particular time not all stations are available to observe.

		                    We are now ready to apply our calibration tables to the data. We will split the data to make imaging easier (e.g. creating different data sets for each source), and in the process of splitting the data we will apply CL4, BP1 and all FG tables to these data.

									We will apply the last calibration table (CL4) and the bandpass table (BP1). Additionally, <tt>aparm</tt> allows us to average the data in frequency and/or time. <tt>aparm 2 1 0</tt> means that we will average all channels per IF, with a time averaging of 1 s. Sometimes you would like to remove the edge channels for each IF as there are noisier. You can do that by setting <tt>bchan</tt> and <tt>echan</tt> (first and last channel to consider, respectively).

		                    As mentioned in the introduction, the imaging process can be done either in AIPS or in Difmap. Here we show a basic running of the AIPS imaging and how to obtain a map of your source. See the end of this page to find a more detailed tutorial on how to image and self-calibrate your data within Difmap and AIPS in case of phase-referencing experiments, or how to analyze EVN spectral line data.

									You want to select the correct file <tt><i>n</i></tt> containing the source to be imaged. Given that SPLIT files are single-source files, you do not need to specify the source name. Depending on the observation you may want to produce a larger image (<tt>imsize</tt> sets the number of pixels on each direction) and an appropriate pixel size (<tt>cellsize</tt> which is measured in arcsec). The pixel size should be always a fraction of your synthesized beam (approx. 5-10 times smaller). Finally, one important parameter is the <tt>robust</tt> value, which determines the weighting during imaging. In AIPS a natural weighting is given by a robust value of 5, an uniform weighting is -5, and 0 is somewhere in between. Whereas a natural weighting produces a more sensitive images with lower resolution, a uniform one produces a higher resolution image but with a lower signal-to-noise. <tt>dotv</tt> implies that the cleaning procedure will run interactively, which is always recommended in VLBI data reduction.

						<p>
							There are two basic tasks in AIPS to perform measurements in your image, <tt>imstat</tt> (or <tt>tvstat</tt>) and <tt>jmfit</tt>.
						</p>
						
						<h5 class="page-header">imstat</h5>
						<p>
							<tt>imstat</tt> tells you the statistics of the image. After showing your image with <tt>tvall</tt> you just need to run <tt>imstat</tt>. You will see a message log as the following, reporting the mean, rms, maximum, minimum and minimum brightness and their positions in the image.

						<h5 class="page-header">tvstat</h5>
						<p>
							<tt>tvstat</tt> is analog to <tt>imstat</tt> but you are able to select a particular region of the image where to perform the statistics. This can be useful to measure the rms of the image (selecting a large region around your source but without including it), and the flux density of your source. Once you run <tt>tvstat</tt> you are able to set the region graphically with the mouse.
						</p>
						
						<h5 class="page-header">jmfit</h5>
						<p>
							<tt>jmfit</tt> fits a gaussian to your image. The recommended way to run it is with <tt>tvall; tvwin; go jmfit</tt>, which shows you the image (<tt>tvall</tt>), allows you to select a region of the image around your source (<tt>tvwin</tt>), and run the gaussian fit (<tt>jmfit</tt>). This last command writes the solution in the message log:
